"tl;dr =E2=80=93 put any excess food and cleaning items in the labelled bins=  in the residence halls to donate them to a food bank. Long version: If you saw Melissa's email, it's the same thing, but now with more boxes that will be there for longer! There is now a labelled box in the WH antelounge, and will be one in EH tomorrow, for donating food and toiletries to the Needham Community Council Food Pantry. These boxes will be out through the end of the semester, so feel free to wait until the last moment to put things in. A full list of what kinds of things for which the NCC is looking can be found here <http://needhamcommunitycouncil.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/FP-Wishlist-= May-2018.pdf> .
