Today is/was tdov (trans day of visibility). TDOV is every March 31st. So I googled and gathered some links: http://www.transstudent.org/tdovaction https://www.hrc.org/resources/international-transgender-day-of-visibility https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Transgender_Day_of_Visibility ""International Transgender Day of Visibility is an annual event occurring on March 31 dedicated to celebrating transgender people and raising awareness of discrimination faced by transgender people worldwide."" -Wikipedia So please feel free to click on the links and learn about the issues transgender people face and tdov. But, we're engineers. Here's a list of some transgender engineers who we should celebrate: 1) Lynn Ann Conway, CS major. Worked at IBM. 2) Danielle Bunten Berry, Studied Industrial Engineering. Made video games. 3) Mary Ann Horton, CS major, Internet Pioneer 4) Jennell Jaquays, Fine Arts major, worked on some DnD and popular video games 5) Ophelia Pastrana, uhh her wiki is in Spanish, Economist and Technologist 6) Audrey Tang, High school Drop out?, Programmer, Free software 7) The Wachowskis (sisters), okay their film directors, but they directed scifi movies/series likeSense8, the Matrix, Jupiter Ascending, Cloud Atlas, and many more Expand my list. Correct me. Don't out trans folks. Lastly, this email is to serve as an educational asset and not to speak over trans voices.
